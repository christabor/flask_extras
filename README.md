# Flask Extras
Assorted useful flask views, blueprints, Jinja2 template filters, and templates/macros.

## Overall setup

As of `3.4.0`, filters and templates will automatically be registered and available through the following simple command:

```python
from flask_extras import FlaskExtras
app = Flask('myapp')
FlaskExtras(app)
```

For the old way, check out [this page](wiki/old_setup.md)

## Available features

### Views

Import them like usual:

```python
from flask_extras.views import (
    statuses,
)
```

*Note:* each view must have a valid template in your apps templates dir. See each view for the required names and locations.

*Note:* each view has configuration helpers to inject or configure your app. See source for details.

### Macros

Many more macros are available. You can use them like so:

```html
{% from 'macros.html' import list_group, objects2table %}
```

For the most comprehensive docs, check out each [macro](flask_extras/macros/). Comment "docstrings" are inline using jinja2 comments (these are not rendered in your html).

### Statuses

Provides views for common status codes. Usage:

```python
app = statuses.inject_error_views(app)
```

See source for more.

### Decorators

See the source for more. Usage example:

```python
from flask_extras.decorators import require_headers

app.route('/')
@require_headers(['X-Foo'])
def foo():
    pass
```
